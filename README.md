# Welcome to Our Penetrative AI Exploration

Guided by Xu Huatao (email: HUATAO001@e.ntu.edu.sg), this project is our initial foray into the intriguing world of AI's capability to interpret one-dimensional time-series data from digitized sensors. Our aim is to challenge and evaluate AI models, like ChatGPT, on their anomaly detection abilities, particularly in datasets that mirror the complexity of the real world.

## Objective

Our mission is centered on identifying datasets that not only test the AI's anomaly detection skills but also its comprehension of physical phenomena through time-series data. We're casting our net across several potential sources:

- **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)**: Challenges AI with its rare positive cases.
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: A broad collection of datasets that could meet our criteria.
- **Yahoo Labs Benchmark for Time Series Anomaly Detection**: Offers a blend of synthetic and real data, equipped with anomaly labels.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**: Focuses on transaction data for fraud detection, highlighting data imbalance.
- **Environment Monitoring Datasets**: Including air quality data, these datasets offer clear anomaly standards but with data point frequency limitations.

## Our Journey

This repository serves as a logbook for our journey, documenting the challenges we face, the insights we gain, and our progress in leveraging Penetrative AI for anomaly detection in time-series datasets. It's a narrative of our exploration into AI's potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex data.

Join us in this fascinating exploration into Penetrative AI's capabilities and its future in anomaly detection and beyond.
