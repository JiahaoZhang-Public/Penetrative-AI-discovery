Given the information provided, I will assume that extremely low or high normalized transaction amounts, zero transaction amounts, and repeated exact amounts especially in short time frames are indicative of potentially fraudulent activity. It is important to note that without additional context such as customer behavior, the time of day, or the frequency of transactions on the account, this analysis might produce false positives or negatives:

Anomaly 1
Transaction Time: 19071.0
Transaction Amount: 0.0
Explanation: Transaction amount is zero, which is unusual as it implies no money was exchanged. This could potentially be an error or test transaction and is marked as an anomaly based on the zero normalized amount.

Anomaly 2
Transaction Time: 41743.0
Transaction Amount: 802.52
Explanation: This transaction has a very high normalized amount (0.9720681218052762), which is close to the maximum normalized value observed (1.0) in previous examples marked as fraudulent.

Anomaly 3
Transaction Time: 47316.0
Transaction Amount: 457.95
Explanation: The transaction has a high normalized amount (0.5547009375227112), which is considerably higher than most other transactions and could be considered as an outlier based on previous examples.

Anomaly 4
Transaction Time: 65181.0
Transaction Amount: 825.58
Explanation: This is the highest transaction amount with a normalized value of 1.0. Based on domain knowledge, this is a strong indicator of potential fraud.

Anomaly 5
Transaction Time: 67571.0
Transaction Amount: 549.06
Explanation: Another transaction with a high normalized amount (0.6650597155938854). Transactions with high normalized values have been marked as fraudulent in the few-shot examples.

Anomaly 6
Transaction Time: 110617.0
Transaction Amount: 635.1
Explanation: The transaction has a high normalized transaction amount (0.7692773565251096) which exceeds typical transaction activity, based on the few-shot examples.

List of Anomalous Transaction Times:
19071.0, 41743.0, 47316.0, 65181.0, 67571.0, 110617.0

Overall Thoughts:
The most apparent anomalies pertain to either very high normalized transaction amounts or a lack thereof (zero transactions). Specifically, transactions that approach the maximum normalized transaction amount observed in the data set are considered high-risk and are flagged as potential fraud. However, more granular data (such as account holder patterns, exact time of transactions, merchant type, historical comparisons, greater context on what constitutes normal vs. normalized amounts, and other transaction metadata) could greatly refine this analysis. It should also be considered that high-value transactions may be normal for certain cardholders (e.g., business accounts, high-net-worth individuals), so cross-referencing with account profiles is advised. Repeated transaction amounts in short time frames could also be suspicious but were not available to analyze in this case. This analysis is reliant on pattern recognition and does not substitute a thorough fraud investigation, which would include more advanced statistical techniques and contextual data.
