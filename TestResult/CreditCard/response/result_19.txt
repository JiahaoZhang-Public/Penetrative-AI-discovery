As an AI language model, I'm unable to perform actual data analysis in the sense of executing code, running statistical tests, or using specialized software. However, I can provide you with an illustrative approach to investigate the provided time-series data points for anomalies based on a manual examination of the data and using the context you've provided.

The domain knowledge indicates that anomalies in financial transactions could be due to unusually high amounts or transactions occurring at odd hours. From the few-shot examples, we observe that low normalized amounts and extremely high normalized amounts are sometimes flagged as fraudulent. Also, a transaction amount of 0 has been marked as fraudulent, which suggests that transactions with no monetary exchange could be viewed as suspicious.

We also know that among the transactions, 30% is considered anomalous. Therefore, we can proceed to flag transactions that exhibit patterns similar to the few-shot examples for being fraudulent or normal. Please note that, in a real-world scenario, more sophisticated methods like clustering, outlier detection algorithms, or a rule-based anomaly detection system would be employed.

Using the above understanding, I'll analyze the provided transactions and identify potential anomalies:

List of Anomalous Transactions:

Anomaly 1
Transaction Time: 7891.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: A low normalized amount and a round value of the transaction amount, similar to the examples labeled fraudulent.

Anomaly 2
Transaction Time: 8878.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: Another transaction with a meager normalized amount and a round number, in line with examples of fraud.

Anomaly 3
Transaction Time: 11629.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: Yet again, a low normalized amount and a round transaction amount reflecting potential fraudulent activity.

Anomaly 4
Transaction Time: 11635.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: Consistent with previous fraudulent indicators, a low normalized amount and a round transaction amount.

Anomaly 5
Transaction Time: 29034.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: Similar to other anomalies, a low normalized amount and a round transaction value.

Anomaly 6
Transaction Time: 26888.0
Transaction Amount: 0.76
Explanation: The normalized amount is very low and the transaction amount is a small, precise value, which was marked as fraudulent in the examples.

Anomaly 7
Transaction Time: 62467.0
Transaction Amount: 1402.16
Explanation: This transaction has a normalized amount of 1.0, which is the highest observed in the data set. Large transactions are often scrutinized for anomalies.

Anomaly 8
Transaction Time: 93888.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: Follows the trend of suspicious round value transactions with low normalized amounts.

Anomaly 9
Transaction Time: 94362.0
Transaction Amount: 1.0
Explanation: Same as transaction at 93888.0, this too has low normalized amounts and round value amounts pointing toward potential fraud.

Anomaly 10
Transaction Time: 100501.0
Transaction Amount: 0.76
Explanation: Echoes anomaly 6 with a low normalized amount and a small non-rounded amount, potentially anomalous.

List of Anomalous Transaction Times:
7891.0, 8878.0, 11629.0, 11635.0, 29034.0, 26888.0, 62467.0, 93888.0, 94362.0, 100501.0

Overall Thoughts:
Based on the few-shot examples, transactions with a normalized amount significantly lower than the average, rounded transaction amounts (e.g., values like 1.0), and very high transactions seem to be commonly detected as anomalies or fraudulent activities. Transactions with non-rounded amounts that are still very low could also be considered suspicious. The pattern is that typical user behavior likely involves non-rounded amounts and higher normalized transaction values. Anomalies appear to deviate from this pattern, suggesting potential fraud. In a thorough analysis, additional factors such as the frequency of transactions by the same user and the specific times (e.g., late-night transactions) would also need to be investigated for more accurate anomaly detection.
