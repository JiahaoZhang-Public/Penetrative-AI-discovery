Before providing the analysis, it's important to clarify that as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to perform real-time computations or data analysis. However, based on the provided data and applying some logical assessments, I can suggest possible anomalies. Usually, anomaly detection involves more complex statistical analyses or machine learning techniques which might be applied to the entire dataset to look for patterns, outliers, etc. Since that kind of analysis is not possible here, I will provide a heuristic-based analysis based on the information given.

Given the provided examples and domain knowledge, the cases of possible fraudulent transactions were associated with either:
1. Extreme values, either very high or low transaction amounts (normalized amounts close to 1 or 0 suggest the highest and smallest transactions respectively), or
2. Transactions with amounts of 0, suggesting potential test transactions or errors, which could be used to probe the security of the system.

Let's proceed with identifying anomalies based upon this understanding:

Anomaly 1
Transaction Time: 53084.0
Transaction Amount: 0.0
Explanation: This transaction amount is 0, which in previous examples has been indicated as fraudulent.

Anomaly 2
Transaction Time: 134928.0
Transaction Amount: 0.0
Explanation: Similarly, this transaction amount is also 0, which matches the pattern of fraudulent behavior.

Anomaly 3
Transaction Time: 44854.0
Transaction Amount: 805.57
Explanation: This transaction has a normalized amount of 1.0, which suggests that it is the highest transaction amount in the provided dataset and could be considered anomalous if it is not consistent with the user's transaction history.

List of Anomalous Transaction Times:
53084.0, 134928.0, 44854.0

Overall Thoughts:
Based on the simplistic analysis criteria given, and provided examples of fraudulent behaviors, the transactions listed above have been flagged as potentially anomalous. However, it's worth noting that to truly determine fraudulent activities, one would typically utilize broader contextual information, more detailed patterns (like the time of day), and sophisticated analytical methods such as time-series analysis, clustering, or machine learning models trained on labeled data to discover anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities. Additionally, individual spending habits and historical transaction data would assist in discerning unusual activities more accurately. This could include looking at the frequency of transactions, the variation in amounts, patterns related to time stamps (like late-night transactions), and comparing transactions against established customer profiles.
