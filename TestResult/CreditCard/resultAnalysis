Since the CreditCard dataset only contains 'Time' and 'Amount',
and the physical meaning is albuminous ,so given a time series of (Time, Amount),
it is nearly impossible to test or use the general knowledge of LLMs.


I have access the Yahoo dataset,however,there is a big problem:
The dataset contains only 3 useful categories(Time,Amount,anomaly)
and other columns are PCA components of the properties which are from individual information and can not be shown to public.
 And the proportion of the positive examples(anomaly) is small while the whole dataset is big,
 How can I design a experiment to deal with these challenges. Up to now ,I have try this naive way but failed:
 I randomly select a subset with 30% anomaly and 70% normal ,and build the dataset in time increasement oder.
 However,since the yahoo dataset is lack of real world meaning, a LLM can not easily use its general knowledge.
